# fortnite_stat_tracker

An application that allows a user to view their account stats on fortnite.   

  This application asks for the user's Epic account ID and platform (PC, Playstation, and Xbox). Once the user presses the search button, the application will display the user's overall stats. If the account ID is invalid, then "Invalid Account ID" wil be displayed instead of user stats. When the user hits return, the application will reload the previous page, aloowing the user to search for another account.
